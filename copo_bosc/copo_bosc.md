The aim of open science is to make scientific research accessible to
an inquiring public. This often involves mechanisms for preserving and
publishing research artefacts such as data, methods, and software in
an efficient and timely manner.

Existing mechanisms for enabling open science in plant research,
particularly within the genomics field but also high-throughput
transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, are limited in a number
of ways: (i) complicated and time-consuming procedures for repository
deposition; (ii) digital gap or lack of interoperability between
disparate information sources; (iii) sub-optimal search and retrieval
facilities across data repositories.

We present COPO (Collaborative Open Plant Omics), an information
aggregation and publishing platform, to help plant scientists publish
and share research outputs, but also to ease access to important
services across disparate sources of information. In particular, COPO
uses a Web front-end and a set of APIs (Application Programming
Interfaces) to facilitate the aggregation of disparate sources of
information into logical profiles representing a body of research. A
profile can contain, for example, sequence of data, source codes, and
pdf files, all of which are described with associated meta
data. In the first instance, the system is positioned as a brokering
system, providing a useable interface to different repositories in
order to offload the burden of data deposition from scientists. Upon
deposition, DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)
